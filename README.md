~ Hello ~

I'm currently learning about C++, Ruby, Python, Objective C, Swift.
I also learned C#, .NET, Fast API, Java, Javascript.  

I'm making mods from Minecraft and currently learning C++ and OpenGL to create an engine and make better games.

I'm planning to develops game myself so wait patiently. --

Expect projects in a year or two.
